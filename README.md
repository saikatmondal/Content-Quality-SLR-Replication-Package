# Enhancing Content Quality in Developer Forums: A Systematic Literature Review

## Abstract
Online developer forums (e.g., Stack Overflow) have evolved into a critical knowledge infrastructure that supports large-scale problem solving, collaboration, and learning in modern software engineering. However, persistent deficiencies in content quality limit knowledge reuse, hinder developer productivity, and compromise the reliability of both human- and AI-assisted software engineering workflows. Over the past 18 years, a large body of research has proposed metrics, models, and interventions to assess and enhance the quality of diverse forum artifacts (e.g., questions, answers, titles, tags, and comments), but the evidence remains fragmented across content types, platforms, and evaluation practices. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we retrieved 4,571 candidate papers from 14 major scholarly databases and selected 127 primary studies published between 2008 and 2025 through a rigorous multi-stage filtration. We analyze the full text of each study and apply a Grounded Theory-based synthesis (open, axial, and selective coding) to organize the literature by targeted artifacts and analytical components, quality assessment metrics, adopted methodologies, evaluation strategies, reported limitations, and future research directions. We further provide a quantitative, longitudinal overview of publication trends and research intensity across venues and over time. Our synthesis highlights common patterns and divergences in how content quality is measured and improved across developer forums and content categories, and consolidates challenges, practical recommendations, and evidence-based directions for future research on automated and semi-automated quality support.

## Research Question–Wise Analyzed Datasets

All datasets are organized by research questions (RQ1–RQ7). Each dataset corresponds directly to the analyses and results presented in the paper.

### RQ1: Taxonomy of targeted content artifacts and analyzed components.
**Objective.** We present a taxonomy of content artifacts targeted for quality assessment and enhancement (e.g., questions, answers, tags, titles, and comments), as well as the analytical components examined by primary studies (e.g., textual content, metadata, user profiles, and interaction signals).

**Dataset.**  
- `RQ1/RQ1-Target-And-Analyzed-Components.csv`  
  **Columns.**
	- `Target Content`: Targeted content artifact (e.g., question, answer, tag, title, comment)  
	- `Analyzed Components`: Analyzed components (e.g., text, metadata, user information, interaction features)

### RQ2: Quality metrics for assessing content quality
