# Enhancing Content Quality in Developer Forums: A Systematic Literature Review

Online developer forums (e.g., Stack Overflow) have evolved into a critical knowledge infrastructure that supports large-scale problem solving, collaboration, and learning in modern software engineering. However, persistent deficiencies in content quality limit knowledge reuse, hinder developer productivity, and compromise the reliability of both human- and AI-assisted software engineering workflows.
Over the past 18 years, a large body of research has proposed metrics, models, and interventions to assess and enhance the quality of diverse forum artifacts (e.g., questions, answers, titles, tags, and comments), but the evidence remains fragmented across content types, platforms, and evaluation practices. In this systematic literature review (SLR), we retrieved 4,571 candidate papers from 14 major scholarly databases and selected 127 primary studies published between 2008 and 2025 through a rigorous multi-stage filtration. We analyze the full text of each study and apply a Grounded Theory-based synthesis (open, axial, and selective coding) to organize the literature by targeted artifacts and analytical components, quality assessment metrics, adopted methodologies, evaluation strategies, reported limitations, and future research directions. We further provide a quantitative, longitudinal overview of publication trends and research intensity across venues and over time. Our synthesis highlights common patterns and divergences in how content quality is measured and improved across developer forums and content categories, and consolidates challenges, practical recommendations, and evidence-based directions for future research on automated and semi-automated quality support.
